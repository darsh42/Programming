ADDRESSING MODES

IMMEDIATE - directly parse value to CPU
REGISTER - loads data from register in instruction
INDEXED - contains start address AND index from start address
INDIRECT - pointer to register which holds the pointer to data
BASE POINTER - SIMILAIR to INDIRECT but, offset is added to register before lookup
